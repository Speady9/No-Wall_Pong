# No-Wall Pong
This is Pong clone made using Pycharm and Pygame for a class project.

All sounds and music are sourced from Freesound.org.
All sprites were designed by me.

Please ignore the .idea and venv folders, as they are assets included with the Pycharm and Pygame interpreters. They are not required for running the program.
